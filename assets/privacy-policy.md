 - **App Name:** Prayer Tracker 
 - **Developer:** MUA Soft

Thank you for using our Prayer Tracker app. Your privacy is extremely important to us.

This app is designed with a simple principle:

> **We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.**

All features of this app function entirely **offline** and all data is stored **locally on your device only**.

---

## Information Collection and Use

We do **not** collect any personally identifiable information.

The app:
- Does not require account creation  
- Does not require login  
- Does not collect names, emails, phone numbers, or location data  
- Does not transmit any usage data to external servers  

All prayer tracking data (such as completed prayers, preferences, reminders, etc.) is stored locally on your device and never leaves your device.

---

## Data Storage

All data generated while using the app:
- Is stored locally on your device storage  
- Is not uploaded to any cloud service  
- Is not accessible by us or any third party  

If you uninstall the app, your data may be permanently deleted unless your device system backs it up locally.

---

## Third-Party Services

This app does **not** use:
- Analytics services  
- Advertising networks  
- Cloud storage  
- External tracking SDKs  

We do not integrate with third-party services that collect personal data.

If distributed through an app store (such as Google Play), the store provider may collect information according to their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of the platform you use.

---

## Log Data

Since we do not operate any servers and do not use analytics tools, we do not collect log data.

However, your device operating system may collect crash logs or diagnostic data independently according to your device settings.

---

## Cookies

This app does not use cookies.

---

## Security

Because your data never leaves your device, you maintain full control over it. We do not have access to your prayer records or personal usage information.

However, please note that device-level security (such as phone lock, encryption, backups, etc.) is the responsibility of the user.

---

## Children’s Privacy

This app does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

Since no data is collected, there is no risk of child data storage or misuse by us.

---

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be reflected on this page with a revised effective date.

We encourage users to review this page periodically for any changes.
